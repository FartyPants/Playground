You have two independent Notebooks that are always present, regardless of the mode.
You can explore variations and try many new things.
You can type in one while the other is generating.

But wait, that's not all!

No. 

The notebooks can enable Quick Instruct mode, where --- (three dashes) signal the line is an instruct (and will be hence formatted accordingly to User/bot prompt)
